I've hacked the code a bit to make sixad work with original and fake GASIA controllers at the same time 
Using it for RetroPie (tested with one original and one fake over bluetooth). 

Original README follows:
-------------------------------------

QtSixA is the Sixaxis Joystick Manager
 ------------------------------------

QtSixA can connect PS3 hardware (Sixaxis/DualShock3, Keypads and Remotes)
to a Linux-compatible machine.

"QtSixA" is the GUI (interface), while "sixad" is the backend C++ code.

Currently sixad supports:
 - Sixaxis/DualShock3 (buttons, axis, accelerometers, leds and rumble)
 - PS3 Keypads
 - PS3 BD Remotes

sixad also registers the hardware's MAC/ID in the device name
(ex: "PLAYSTATION(R)3 Controller (00:XX:X0:0X:XX)".

 -------------------------------------

QtSixA and sixad are licensed under the GNU GPL v2 license.

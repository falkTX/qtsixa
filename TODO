QtSixA TODO list

 - Code joystick timeout (mins)
 - Register sixad in DBus, so we can eventually change settings without re-connect
 - ALSA midi mode
 - DBus sender mode (to control other apps)
 - Get more icons for the notifications (only the Sixaxis one is used at the moment)
 - What is the gyro suppose to do ??
 - Create a new icon!
 - Use user's icon theme instead of just Oxygen


I forgot to tell you that the sixpair path is broken, it is installed in /usr/bin, and qtsixa/gui/qtsixa_main.py tries to launch /usr/sbin/sixpair.
